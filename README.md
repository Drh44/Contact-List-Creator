# Contact-List-Creator
Will create a list of contacts and display their name, phone numbers, and email

This program is set to already have contact information hard coded into it. After the contact list is printed once, a new contact named Kevin is added and the list of contacts is shown again with the updated information. This program can be recreated using user information entered from a file or keyboard as well.
